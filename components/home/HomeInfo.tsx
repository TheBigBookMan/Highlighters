          Highlighters is a social media app where users upload a moment from
          their life that they find was a highlight for that time period. For
          example: if you went on a nice hike one week which you found really
          made your mood better, you can upload an image of that hike with a
          description. You can then look back on all the highlights you have had
          from each week and remember how good life can be!
